            <h3>Background - and why the Cloud Resume Challenge?</h3>
            <h4>10 November 2023</h4>
            <p>
              Prior to 2017 I had spent 19 years working for CSC (now DXC) in
              various solution design/solution architecture roles. My area of
              expertise was in large scale outsourcing of commodity IT services,
              which morphed into private/public/hybrid IaaS services. I was keen
              to try something else by the time the merger with HPE was
              announced, and so gratefully accepted a package in 2017.
              <br />
              <br />
              I made the decision to get back into the IT game around June 2023.
              Goes without saying that six years is a long time in IT, and the
              last six years especially so!
              <br />
              <br />
              My first activity was to load up on a courses and certifications,
              to bring myself up to speed with what's available and what's
              possible today. The ISC^2 courses were broad in nature and
              provided a good overview of the state of play, at least from a
              risk, regulatory and governance perspective. I then crammed my
              head full of over 200 acronyms and service descriptions to gain
              the AWS Practitioner cert.
              <br />
              <br />
              As I was clicking my way through the Azure online training I
              didn't feel I was getting a proper grip on it. For sure, I was
              confident I could sit in a room and make suggestions about how
              things should work, but it didn't feel like a solid foundation.
              <br />
              <br />
              I also realised that if I was to bridge a 6 year gap in IT work
              experience I would need to something to demonstrate all those
              "secondary" skills that made the best of my previous co-workers
              and direct reports stand out from the crowd - just in time
              learning, problem solving, initiative, resilience and persistence.
              <br />
              <br />
              Enter the
              <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/" target="_blank"
                >Cloud Resume Challenge!</a
              >
              To quote Forrest directly:
              <br />
              <br />
              "...the Cloud Resume Challenge isn't a tutorial or a how-to guide.
              It's a project spec, and not a very helpful one at that. It tells
              you what the outcome of the project should be, and provides enough
              structure that you don't go too far off the rails, but other than
              that - you're on your own!"
              <br />
              <br />
              In essence the challenge requires us to build a simple website
              using as many cloud-related services as possible. I do believe
              that getting hands-on with tech is the best way to learn and come
              up to speed with whatâ€™s possible. So, lets get cracking!

            <h3>Project Phase 1 - HTML, Azure Storage and CDN</h3>
            <h4>11 November 2023</h4>
            <p>
              HTML/CSS - the minimum requirement is to convert your resume to
              HTML/CSS. I've probably gone a bit further with the site than the
              challenge requires, but I haven't played with HTML/CSS before and
              found it pretty interesting.
              <br /><br />
              I came across John Smilga's HTML/CSS course on
              <a
                href="https://www.udemy.com/share/101A483@n8hnTgvNlCIZEY6RlytAjmNgbx692bUQsj5yKeORHPDwRh1Y8QIrpC0l-iBgW0na/"
                target="_blank"
                >Udemy.</a
              >
              <br />
              <br />
              I've still got one outstanding issue regarding responsiveness of
              image elements in a mobile browser, otherwise it all seems to
              work. So if you want to experience scrolling text over a fixed
              background, view the site on your laptop not your phone ðŸ™‚
              <br /><br />
              Domain Registration - registering my domain name with Cloudflare
              was pretty straight forward and cheap. By default they offer proxy
              services and general SSL certificate services, both of which I
              disabled. Microsoft CDN takes care of SSL.
              <br />
              <br />
              Azure Storage and CDN - to be honest nothing much to report here -
              it all just works as you would expect. Plenty of how-to's on the
              website.
              <br />
              <br />
              The Azure Tools in Visual Studio Code worked really well - editing
              code directly on the files stored in Azure. However once CDN was
              incorporated versioning issues between the source file and CDN's
              cache arose. So local editing and much purging of cache! This
              problem will be properly addressed once I complete the IaC and
              devOps phases.
              <br />
              <br />
              All up I've spent about 30 hours on the HTML side (course,
              experimenting and troubleshooting), but it only took an extra 3-4
              hours to get through the Azure and Cloudflare stuff.
              <br />
              <br />
              Up next..... Python and Azure Functions!

              Project Phase 2 - Azure Functions, Python, CosmosDB, Key Vault,
              Github
            </h3>
            <h4>28 January 2024</h4>
            <p>
              This section has taken me a bit longer, as I got bogged down with
              Javascript and Python courses (having never written a line of code
              in either prior to December last year), plus Christmas and summer
              holidays.
            </p>
            <br />
            <h5>Azure Functions with Python</h5>
            <p>
              The Microsoft doco refers to a new class-based programming model
              for Python introduced with Azure Functions Python v4+. The new
              approach removes the need for a separate "function.json" file
              containing bindings etc. I found this a bit of a problem given
              many Challengers have used the old version.
              <br />
              <br />
              Following on from the HTML piece I did all the coding in Visual
              Studio Code with a variety of extensions (Python, Github Pull and
              Request Issues, Azure Account, Azure Database, Azure Functions,
              Azure Resources, Azure Static Web Apps, Azure Storage and Azurite
              local storage emulator). Along with the obvious benefits I found
              these helped with a lot of behind-the-scenes config while
              deploying a function from local into Azure, converting local json
              settings to Application Settings for example.
              <br />
              <br />
              The MS articles were a good starting point for creating a function
              locally, then deploying to Azure. The quickstart files also cover
              connecting to a CosmosDB instance.
              <br />

              <br />
              <br />
              Regarding CosmosDB, I want to acknowledge a fellow challenger
              techbrett for the query solution, as its a much more databasey way
              of doing things than the python code I was struggling with:
              <br />
              <a
                href="https://github.com/techbrett/azure-resume/"

              <br />
              <br />
              I've implemented Azure Key Vault to store any credentials or
              access keys required by the solution. The variables defined in
              Azure Application Settings now contain a pointer to the key vault
              rather than the access key itself. There are VSC extensions
              allowing you to read from the Key Vault when doing your local
              development but I haven't gone down that rabbit hole yet. This
              article was helpful, although the screens look slightly different:

            <h5>Github integration and automated deployment</h5>
            <p>
              In hindsight, one should have set this up prior to writing any
              code ðŸ™‚ That said, adding it in afterwards wasn't too much of an
              issue, although strangely Github kept tracking changes on a couple
              of files that I didn't want synched with the repository, even
              though they were added to the .gitignore file. I had to use git
              bash to manually exclude them. ChatGPT to the rescue!
              <br />
              <br />
              I've created two deployment workflows - one for front end and one
              for backend. Make sure when creating the service account as per
              the MS doco you make it a contributor for both the storage RG and
              CDN RG (if you're using CDN). They work well, although both are
              triggered any time a change is made to the main branch, and using
              the commands outlined in the MS doco, that means all files are
              copied up every time. While I'm still making regular changes to
              the website I've reset the workflow to manual for now. Also need
              to think about whether every file needs to be copied up or whether
              a differential copy is more efficient, in which case need to use
              azcopy synch instead.

            <h5>Conclusion and next steps</h5>
            <br />
            <br />
            <p>
              This part of the challenge made my head hurt ðŸ™‚ There are a number
              of moving parts and new concepts all being deployed in parallel
              while being discovered for the first time - IDE integration with
              Github and Azure, Python, local versus remote deployments etc etc.
              Of all the components, practices and processes related to this
              solution, I'd say its my troubleshooting skills have been improved
              the most, and ChatGPT has been indispensible.
              <br />
              <br />
              The two key elements of the challenge that I haven't completed are
              testing and IaC. I'm leaving them for now, as I need to cycle back
              and finish the Python and Javascript courses. Also, I'm heading
              down data path rather than a devops engineer/architect path, and
              have a couple of projects that I want to get cracking on. I
              believe a big tick for me will be the ability to deploy a
              cloud-based platform upon which the data analysis can be run. This
              project has therefore given me a strong foundation for the next
              phase.
